# DreamSense
**DreamSense** is a Streamlit web app that turns written dreams into creative interpretations. Users describe a dream, answer a few follow‑up questions, and receive a poem, image, or (soon) a melody. It uses Hugging Face models, Stable Diffusion, and Google TTS to deliver a simple, human‑centred way to explore dream symbolism.
